Palette source: W3C
When computers only supported 256 different colors, a list of 216 "Web Safe Colors" was suggested as a Web standard, reserving 40 fixed system colors.
This 216 cross-browser color palette was created to ensure that all computers would display colors correctly.
The palette is published here:
